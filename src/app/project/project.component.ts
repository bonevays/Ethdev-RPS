        It’s a small tournament  like 8 or 16 people. that can put any amount of ether on the tournament it doesn’t really matter. the things is no one is gonna win the prize pool. but instead the winner choose which charity address the prize pool goes to. so the mini game that would run with it could change but i had the idea of a rock-paper-scissor sequence type.
        like one player would send his message "charity A" 'paper-paper-rock'
        and the prize pool goes to the choice of the person that won the mini-tournament
